      <p id="myself">My name is Aditya Raj and I am writing my own biography my
           birth place is in Nalanda District located at Bihar state and country
           is India. I was born on 24 August 1999 since from my childhood to 2014
            I studied in the st. Joseph Academy  school  upto grade 10 and then
            for my further study I joined resonance Institute located at
             Kota( Rajasthan). After 2 year of the study I return back to my home
              and decided to pursue my career in computer science and so I joined
               Udacity nanodegree program to enhance my knowledge and this is my
               story upto 2018 and  now My life is  on to live adventurous life.
